Automatically generated int -> syscall conversions for different platforms

syscall_arm.tbl, syscall_powerpc.tbl, syscall_x86_64.tbl are tables of syscall
codes on arm, powerpc, and x86, respectively. These files are located under the
`src/Stubs/Syscall/Names` subdirectory in the
`stubs-common-{aarch32,powerpc,x86}` packages. Their sources are given at the
top of each file.

To generate the data used in AArch32/Linux.hs, PPC32/Linux.hs, PPC64/Linux.hs,
and X86_64/Linux.hs, run one of the following commands and paste the output
into the list literal:

* For AArch32: `./generate_table.py ../../../../../stubs-common-aarch32/src/Stubs/Syscall/Names/syscall_arm.tbl`
* For x86_64:  `./generate_table.py ../../../../../stubs-common-x86/src/Stubs/Syscall/Names/syscall_x86_64.tbl --exclude-abi x32`
* For PPC32:   `./generate_table.py ../../../../../stubs-common-ppc/src/Stubs/Syscall/Names/syscall_powerpc.tbl --exclude-abi 64 --exclude-abi spu`
* For PPC64:   `./generate_table.py ../../../../../stubs-common-ppc/src/Stubs/Syscall/Names/syscall_powerpc.tbl --exclude-abi 32 --exclude-abi spu`
