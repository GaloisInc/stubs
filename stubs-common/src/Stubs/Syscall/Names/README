Automatically generated int -> syscall conversions for different platforms

syscall_arm.tbl and syscall_x86_64.tbl are tables of syscall codes on arm and x86 respectively.
Their sources are given at the top of each file.

To generate the data used in AArch32/Linux.hs and X86_64/Linux.hs, run one of
the following commands and paste the output into the list literal:

* For AArch32: `./generate_table.py syscall_arm.tbl`
* For x86_64:  `./generate_table.py syscall_x86_64.tbl --exclude-abi x32`
